### Features

Just like toxcore, µTox is still alpha software, so you may encounter bugs, or maybe a crash or two. µTox also needs your help. If you do encounter any bugs or problems please open an issue.

µTox releases a new version on the 20th of every month. So you can always know when to get the newest version.
